                Alright, today we are actually not even that close to being done. But we are getting there! Some questions
                need to be answered first, though. Like, what are we? Where are we located in the
                body exactly? The brain? The heart? The gut? The whole body? Or maybe we are not even located in the body
                at all? Maybe we are existing in a remote environment and just sharing the view, just like a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a>?
